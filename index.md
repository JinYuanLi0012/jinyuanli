## About Me

I am a second-year master student at Tianjin University, guided by Dr. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at [Baidu](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/). I'm passionate about exploring Multimodal Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Recently, I focus on activating the potential of large language models in more complex multimodal tasks. 

## Research Interests

- **Multimodal Machine Learning:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Natural Language Processing:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
