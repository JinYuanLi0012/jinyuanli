## About Me

I am a second-year master student at Tianjin University, guided by Dr. [Gang Pan](https://gpantju.github.io/index/). Currently, I am working as a research intern at [Baidu](https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/). I'm passionate about exploring Multimodal Machine Learning. Recently, I focus on activating the potential of large language models in more complex multimodal tasks. 

## Research Interests

- **Natural Language Processing:** (Vision) Large Language Model, Multimodal Information Extraction
- **Computer Vision:** Open-Vocabulary Object Detection, Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation, Image Inpainting

## News

- **[Apr. 2024]** Very happy to join Baidu as a Computer Vision research intern.
- **[Feb. 2024]** A new research about Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) and Large Language Model has been released! see [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09989).
- **[Oct. 2023]** One paper about Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (MNER) is accepted to Findings of EMNLP 2023.
